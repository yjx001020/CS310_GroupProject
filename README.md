To build this project,
Run createTable.sql on MySQLworkbench to generate the local database with connection to 127.0.0.1:3306
The connection username is "root". Password is "vincent0124!".
To use your own password, replace the global variable "PASSWORD" in app/src/main/java/com/csci310/cs310_groupproject/MainActivity.java to connect to the Database.


When creating a new event invitation, the user needs to enter the location in a form of two numbers like “34,118” with no white spaces, where the first number is the latitude and the second number is the longitude. 

We have not implemented the feature to set the user photo.
We plan to implement the missing features in the next sprint.
